	When the user requests motion from a Freespace device using a 
	Data Mode Control V2 Request, the user must provide a Format by setting the
	formatSelect field and then request data fields by setting the appropriate Format
	Flags. The Format determines the different data fields that can be
	transmitted, and the Format Flags determine which fields are actually
	transmitted in the MotionEngine Output Packet. The MotionEngine Output Packets
	that are transmitted in response to a Data Mode Control V2 Request will have
	the same formatSelect and Format Flag values as the Request, plus the appropriate
	real-time data. Below is a table which outlines the available data fields by 
	Format and Format Flag:

	Format Flag 	|	formatSelect = 0	|	formatSelect = 1	|	formatSelect = 2	|	formatSelect = 3
	----------------|-----------------------|-----------------------|-----------------------|-------------------
	FF0		|	Pointer					|	Acceleration					|	Reserved			|	Pointer
	FF1		|	Linear Acceleration		|	Linear Acceleration, No Gravity	|	Reserved			|	Linear Acceleration	
	FF2		|	Linear Acceleration, No Gravity	|	Angular Velocity		|	Reserved			|	Linear Acceleration, No Gravity
	FF3		|	Angular Velocity		|	Magnetometer					|	Reserved			|	Angular Velocity
	FF4		|	Magnetometer			|	Inclination						|	Reserved			|	Magnetometer
	FF5		|	Temperature				|	Compass Heading					|	Reserved			|	Temperature	
	FF6		|	Angular Position (WXYZ)	|	Angular Position (XYZW)			|	Reserved			|	Angular Position (WXYZ)	
	FF7		|	Reserved	|	Activity Classification/Power Management Flags	|	Reserved		|	Reserved

	For more information about using the Data Mode Control V2 Request and MotionEngine Output Packet, or for detailed
	information about the meaning, units, and orientation of these data fields, please refer to the 1000-2984 HCOMM Reference Manual.
